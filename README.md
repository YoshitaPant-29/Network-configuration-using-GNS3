# Network-configuration-using-GNS3

Network Configuration Project using GNS3| Nov 2023	Technologies: GNS3,Network Protocols,IP Addressing and Subnetting
Configured a complex network topology using GNS3 wit classless IP addressing to ensure minimal IP wastage
Successfully established connectivity between Routers using PING command

##AIM
Configure the given topology in Figure 1 with classless addressing with minimum or no IP wastage using GNS 3. Show the connectivity using the PING 
command from:
c) R1 to R6, and d) R3 to R9 e) R3 to R5-------------- In testing the PING command, kindly write the issues, which results in the unsuccessful connection 
if occurred in GNS3

## INTRODUCTION
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is another name for classless addressing. This addressing type aids in the more efficient allocation of IP addresses. This 
technique assigns a block of IP addresses based on specified conditions when the user demands a specific amount of IP addresses. This block is known as a 
"CIDR block", and it contains the necessary number of IP addresses.There are two forms of IP addressing: classful and classless. The primary 
distinction between classful and classless addressing is that classless addressing provides for a more efficient allocation of IP addresses than classful addressing. 
In a nutshell, classless addressing avoids the problem of IP address exhaustion that can arise with classful addressing
